## why react ?

- when our app / website became big then working with vanila js, became  headache (but not imposible) , complex, challenging
- with react we break whole website into small part (components) and react use that components efficiently
- components help us to write reusable , modular and better organized code

1. node js(recommended)

3. install prettier extension
