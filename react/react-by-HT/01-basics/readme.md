## Why React was created

Facebook faces the problem of phantom (gost) massege: when the user receives a massage, he or she reads the massage, or may be he or she responded to the massage, but after it, the massage icon wants to go or not update. (Once the massage is read, it can still show that the user has any massage.) -> inconsistency of ui This is a major source of react origin .

state (variabel)-> Js(<- need to communication or sync->)Ui -> DOM

**gole of reat is :-Improve performance, efficiency, and maintainability of UI development.**
